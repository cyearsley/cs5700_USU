How to use the program:
	1) compile and run the program.
	2) You will be prompted to enter a file a (I have supplied all the test data that was provided via canvas).
		i) by entering either "xml" or "json", it will parse a .xml or .json respectively.
		ii) the default files being parsed are: PersonTestSet_01.json and PersonTestSet_11.xml.
		iii) my parser was implemented to fit the structure of the example data that was given to us.

	3) Once the file has been parsed you will be asked what file you would like to write to (with the data collected).
		i) This file will be created in the src/ directory (or modified).
	
	4) You will then be able to view the data calculated in both the file you specified and the console.

UML Diagram:
	I have supplied the UML diagram (built in Dia) as a PDF within the project folder.

Unit Tests:
	1) I have created some unit tests under the directory tests/ for MOST of the functions that are checking for relationships between people.
	2) I used JUnit4 to run my tests (all passed with flying colors).

If you have any questions or concerns, please let me know.
